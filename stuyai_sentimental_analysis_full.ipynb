            "My recent stay at Absalon Hotel was, unfortunately, a series of disappointments from the moment we arrived.  The first issue we encountered was the state of the reception area. It was dirty and looked nothing like the photos on the hotel’s website, which already gave us a bad first impression.  After checking in we got a small 11-13m2 room. The cleanliness of the room was unacceptable. The floor was dirty, the toilet had fecal stains, there was hair from previous guests on the floor, and worst of all, the bed was full of body hair from other people. For a hotel that claims to be four stars, the hygiene standards were shockingly low.  We did make a complaint about the state of the room, and to their credit, the hotel staff cleaned the room and gave us a voucher for a cappuccino at the bar.  The breakfast was another major letdown. The selection was extremely limited, with only two types of cheese, a couple of varieties of ham and sausage, boiled eggs, bread, toast, croissants, and some conserved fruits, muesli, and yogurt. Additionally, the only coffee available was filter coffee, which tasted bad. If you wanted a cappuccino or a latte, you had to pay 40 dk extra at the bar. For a four-star European hotel, this breakfast was well below standard.  On top of all this, the breakfast area was overcrowded, and we had to wait to find a free table. Overall, the hotel’s services and conditions did not live up to its four-star rating, and I would not recommend it to other travelers.\n",
